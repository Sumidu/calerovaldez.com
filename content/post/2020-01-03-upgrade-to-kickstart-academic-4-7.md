# New year, new version 

I have started to migrate my website to version 4.7. Since I was using version 2.4, almost all changes seem to be breaking changes.
I'll try to find a way to improve publication import using some automation. 
Other things I'll try this time:

* Move all course material to github and their own repositories.
* Have a RStudio.cloud workspace prepared for the website (done!)
  * including Github connection (done!)
* Post more frequently!
* Maybe use the slides feature?
* Keep things more simple :)
