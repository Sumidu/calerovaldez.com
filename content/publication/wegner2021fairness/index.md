  The connections between the perception of trust, fairness, and regulatory needs regarding artificial intelligence have not been sufficiently investigated, yet. We address this research gap and analyze the role of trust, acceptance, and confidence in technology use towards the need for regulations and perceptions of fairness of artificial intelligence. A quantitative questionnaire (n= 103) was used to empirically and deductively study the aforementioned research question and established hypotheses. Overall, the results suggest most importantly trust has an impact on assessing the fairness of AI, and that it correlates with regulatory needs. Furthermore, we found that trust and a lack of regulatory needs predict the assessment of perceived AI fairness, explaining 41% of the variance. We also found that the usage context has a significant impact on perceived fairness and regulatory needs. Interestingly, teaching showed the …
