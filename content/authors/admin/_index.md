André Calero Valdez is Senior Researcher at the Chair of Communication Science and Human-Computer Interaction Center at RWTH Aachen University.

He studied computer science at RWTH Aachen University, specializing in software engineering and psychology. Due to his excellent degree, he was awarded a doctoral scholarship by the RWTH Aachen University. In his dissertation, André dealt with user-centered development and evaluation of a small-screen device for diabetes patients. 

Since 2013, André has been working as a post-doctoral fellow at RWTH Aachen University and deals with the interface between algorithms and humans in different application areas. He works in the fields of empirical social research, technology acceptance, eHeatlh, industry 4.0, recommendation systems, information visualization and social media.

Since 2014 André is visiting professor at the Medical University Graz at the HCI-KDD Group with Prof. Dr. Andreas Holzinger, where his research focuses on the integration of computerized methods and machine learning in health care.

Since 2018 André is the research group leader of the junior research group "Digitale Mündigkeit". In this research group, the interaction of recommendation algorithms, social bots, and fake news in social media are investigated.
