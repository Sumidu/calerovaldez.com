abstract: The digitization of the world has also led to a digitization of communication processes. Traditional research methods fall short in understanding communication in digital worlds as the scope has become too large in volume, variety, and velocity to be studied using traditional approaches. In this paper, we present computational methods and their use in public and mass communication research and how those could be adapted to professional communication research. The paper is a proposal for a panel in which the panelists, each an expert in their field, will present their current work using computational methods and will discuss transferability of these methods to professional communication.
