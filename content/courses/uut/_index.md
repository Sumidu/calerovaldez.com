In this course students learn how to apply the methods of empirical research in a self-directed research project. The focus is to integrate user-diversity aspects with usability and technology acceptance in differing topcis. Students may pick their own research question, decide on methods and collect their own data. In several project "pitches" students discuss the topics and their current state of work. 

Students have to deliver a final presentation and three pitches. As a term paper they have to deliver a 15-20 page research report in the form of a scientific publication.

The course is held every winter semester.
