<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Since the term “Simulation” or modeling was used frequently in the media recently to get an understanding of the spread of covid-19, I have created an instructive agent-based model for the simulation of disease spread and limited hospital capacities. Since this model is only “instructive” for the purpose of understanding modeling, I have also created a video to explain the model and some implications due to the simplicity of the design.</p>
<p>Please watch the video first, before playing around with the simulation:

<p>You can test the Simulation yourself here: <a href="http://bit.ly/NLinfection" class="uri">http://bit.ly/NLinfection</a></p>
<p>If you are interested in seeing the current case numbers in comparison to other countries, have a look at this shiny application that I made:
