## Course information
In this seminar students were introduced to the programming environment NetLogo. Netlogo provides the means for simple agent-based models as well as a complex simulation environment.

The task of students was to model the spread of information in different scenarios using agent-based models.
As the term paper students have to hand in a model and a analysis using the behavior space tool in netlogo.

### Course schedule
The course is held in the **summer semester 2018**.
