The singular value decomposition recommendation system was able to correctly predict more than half of all evaluations and performed better than participants expected. However, users were more satisfied with the suggestions of the user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system. Our approach allows to compare actual item ratings, expected quality, and perceived quality of recommendations. Serendipity was …
